- Proabably doesnt work anymore, created in 2017/2018, and the ap and stuff roabably has changed
- Missing a GPS function
- Missing tying everything together

A partly solution to in my opinion missing features in the application for Oslo Citibikes, and that is a way to plan your route, like GPS, but with the which stops to park your bike, in response to where you are going.

So this program takes a start adress and a destination adress, calculates bike availibailty and calculates which bikerack that is closest to your position, and tells you the way to the bike rack that are closest to your destination.
