Project Speech to text:

Goal is to receive speech through the pc's microphone, converting the speech to text.

Further this can be used as several things, as a way  to execute commands, or as a chatbot.

This task is chosen because it is interesting and can easily be extended to include a lot of different commands over several files. Can be a good start for a really big and diverse chatbot, or a JARVIS kind of software.  

The main goal for me personally is to learn the different aspects that this task requires:
- Activate the microphone
- Storing the recorded sound as a sound file
- Converting the sound file to written text using machine learning:
	- Sufficent dataset is needed to train a model:
		- Create own?
		- Finding online?
- Text to other commands- should be the absolute easiest task, one that i am familiar with
- TBA
